Principals consistently relied on his wisdom, integrity, practical guidance and leadership skills. I am confident this consulting ministry will be a tremendous blessing to Catholic school leaders and the communities they serve."</blockquote>

              <blockquote>"For eleven years, Dr. Vincent Cascone and I worked closely together, serving as pastor and principal in a Kansas City Mo. parish where quality education was highly valued. Leading such a school meant that Vince's job was both challenging and multifaceted as he was continually required to balance the often-conflicting expectations of teachers, students, and parents. Throughout his tenure, there was a broad community consensus that Dr. Cascone managed these responsibilities with both wisdom and expertise, earning his leadership widespread respect."</blockquote>
