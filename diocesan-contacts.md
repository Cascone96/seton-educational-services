# U.S. Catholic Archdioceses & Dioceses — Superintendent Contact Directory

## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

This document lists **every Latin Church archdiocese and diocese in the United States** (178 total: 33 archdioceses + 145 dioceses). For each, the diocese's general website is provided where available.

**To find the current Superintendent of Catholic Schools for each diocese**, use these strategies:

1. **NCEA Membership Directory** — The National Catholic Educational Association maintains an internal directory of all diocesan Catholic school leaders. As an NCEA member, you can access this. Contact NCEA at (571) 257-0010 or visit [ncea.org](https://ncea.org).
2. **Individual Diocese Websites** — Visit the diocese website listed below and look for "Catholic Schools," "Office of Education," or "School Office" in the menu. The superintendent's name, phone, and email are almost always listed there.
3. **The Official Catholic Directory (OCD)** — Published annually by P.J. Kenedy & Sons, this is the most comprehensive printed directory of Catholic Church personnel in the US. Available at most Catholic university libraries.
4. **Direct Call** — Call the diocese's main number (easily found via the website below) and ask to be connected to the Catholic Schools Office or Superintendent of Schools.

> **Why not pre-filled names/emails?** Superintendent positions turn over regularly. A pre-filled list would be outdated within months. The strategies above ensure you always reach the **current** superintendent.

## HOW TO FIND EACH SUPERINTENDENT

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. Visit the diocese website listed above
2. Look for: "Catholic Schools," "Office of Education," "School Office," or "Superintendent"
3. The superintendent's name, direct phone number, and email are typically listed on the schools page
4. If not found online, call the diocese's main phone number and ask for the Catholic Schools Office

### Best Single Sources for All Superintendents at Once:

| Source | Access | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **NCEA Diocesan Catholic School Leaders Directory** | NCEA membership required | Most comprehensive and current single source |
| **The Official Catholic Directory (OCD)** | Purchase or library | Published annually; includes all personnel |
| **USCCB Directory** | usccb.org | Lists bishops; may link to school offices |
| **NCEA Annual Convention** | Attend or access attendee list | Many superintendents attend; great for networking |

### Recommended Outreach Strategy:
1. **Start with NCEA** — Join if not already a member; access the full superintendent directory
2. **Prioritize Midwest dioceses** — Start local and expand outward
3. **Present at NCEA Convention** — Puts you in front of hundreds of superintendents at once
4. **Request introductions** — Ask superintendents you know to introduce you to peers
5. **Contact diocesan school offices directly** — Use the websites above; send your capability statement

## TEMPLATE: OUTREACH EMAIL TO SUPERINTENDENT

Subject: Catholic School Principal Mentoring & Leadership Development — Seton Educational Services, LLC

Dear [Superintendent Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Dr. Vince Cascone, and I am the founder of Seton Educational Services, LLC, a consulting practice dedicated to developing and supporting Catholic school principals.

Having served as a Catholic school principal for 19 years and as a diocesan superintendent for 7 years, I understand the critical importance of strong principal mentoring and development. I was honored to be recognized as both the NAESP and NCEA National Distinguished Principal of the Year, and I hold a Doctorate in Educational Leadership.

I am reaching out because I work with diocesan Catholic school offices to:

- Design and facilitate principal mentoring programs
- Provide coaching for new and experienced principals
- Deliver customized professional development for school leaders
- Develop leadership pipeline programs

I would welcome the opportunity to learn about your diocese's current efforts in principal development and to explore how I might support your work. I have attached a one-page capability statement for your review.

Would you have 20-30 minutes for a brief phone call or virtual meeting in the coming weeks? I am happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your dedication to Catholic education. I look forward to connecting.

In Christ,

Dr. Vince Cascone, Ed.D.
