I am confident this consulting ministry will be a tremendous blessing to Catholic school leaders and the communities they serve."</blockquote>

Leading such a school meant that Vince's job was both challenging and multifaceted as he was continually required to balance the often-conflicting expectations of teachers, students, and parents. Throughout his tenure, there was a broad community consensus that Dr. Cascone managed these responsibilities with both wisdom and expertise, earning his leadership widespread respect."</blockquote>
